### Welcome to my repository intro-programacion
In this repository you can find some basic C++ programming exercises, as well as a project focused on string encryption with 3 easy methods. 

Everything coded here is not debugged or optimized since its realization, so you will probably find better ways to solve these exercises, I recommend you to take it only as a guide. 

Thanks for reading 👩‍💻
